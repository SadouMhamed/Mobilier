# Debugging 500 Error on Login Page

## Current Status

You're experiencing a 500 error when trying to access the login page. This is likely not related to the HTTPS changes we made.

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Test Basic Routing

First, test if basic routing works:

-   Visit: `https://mobilier-pq35.onrender.com/test`
-   This should return: `{"status":"ok","message":"Basic routing works"}`

### 2. Check Application Logs

The 500 error details should be in your application logs. Check:

-   Render dashboard → Your app → Logs
-   Look for recent error messages around the time you get the 500 error

### 3. Common Causes of 500 Errors

#### A. Database Connection Issues

-   Check if your database is properly configured
-   Verify database credentials in Render environment variables
-   Ensure database is accessible from your app

#### B. Missing Environment Variables

-   Verify all required environment variables are set in Render
-   Check if `APP_KEY` is properly generated
-   Ensure database connection variables are correct

#### C. File Permission Issues

-   Check if storage and bootstrap/cache directories are writable
-   Verify file permissions on the server

#### D. PHP Version Compatibility

-   Ensure your PHP version is compatible with Laravel 11
-   Check if all required PHP extensions are installed

### 4. Quick Fixes to Try

#### Enable Debug Mode Temporarily

Add this to your render.yaml temporarily:

```yaml
- key: APP_DEBUG
  value: true
```

This will show detailed error messages instead of a generic 500 error.

#### Check Database Connection

Add this test route to verify database connectivity:

```php
Route::get('/db-test', function () {
    try {
        \DB::connection()->getPdo();
        return response()->json(['status' => 'ok', 'message' => 'Database connected']);
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        return response()->json(['status' => 'error', 'message' => $e->getMessage()]);
    }
});
```

### 5. Next Steps

1. Deploy the current changes
2. Test the `/test` route first
3. Check Render logs for specific error messages
4. If needed, temporarily enable debug mode to see detailed errors
5. Report back with any specific error messages you find

### 6. Rollback Plan

If the issue persists, we can:

1. Remove the HTTPS-related changes temporarily
2. Focus on fixing the core application issue first
3. Re-apply HTTPS fixes once the app is stable

## Expected Outcome

After following these steps, you should be able to:

-   Identify the specific cause of the 500 error
-   Access the login page without issues
-   Have both the application working AND HTTPS assets loading properly
